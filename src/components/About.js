                <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
                <p>My favorite hobby is to play disc golf with friends because it is a great free exercise, and it takes a good amount of
                    skill to play </p>
                <h2>Purpose of this application?</h2>
                <p>This app will help players to keep track of their Disc Golf Scores and Details so that they can continue to find more places to play, people to play with, and past scores to see how much they have improved each time they go out to play a game. </p>

                <h2>Why did I want to become a web developer?</h2>
                <p>Because programming is awesome and being able to make a difference in this world in a constantly
                    changing environment is very rewarding. I also love the design aspect of building something creative and hip for someone else to use. </p>
