                <h6> More About Me </h6>
                <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
                <p>My favorite hobby is to play disc golf because it is a great free exercise, it takes a good amount of
                    skill, and its extremely fun. </p>
                <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
                <p>My dream job is similar to my current job except instead of problem-solving in the financial world, I
                    would be doing it on the frontEnd of web development.</p>
                <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
                <p>I currently live in another suburb city outside of St. Louis, called Affton</p>
                <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
                <p>Because programming is awesome and being able to make a difference in this world in a constantly
                    changing environment makes more sense in my eyes. At my current job I am making a difference but
                    they are small scale differences. Programming would be helping people on a much larger scale. </p>
